                        <h4>The Benefits of a Morning Routine</h4>
                        <p>
                            As Hal Elrod, author of “The Miracle Morning”, says,
                        </p>
                        <div class="paraback">
                        <p>
                            A morning routine is said to boost happiness, increase productivity, reduce stress levels and get you grounded and settled for the day. It’s about getting started on the ‘right foot’.

A morning routine also allows you to start your morning with intention, rather than letting the day run away from you. You control the day; the day doesn’t control you. This positive feeling of being on top of things has results in a positive feeling and effect on your entire day.

                <h3>Set goals</h3>
                <p>I have a friend that puts up three Post-it notes every morning. They include the three most important goals for the day. This gives something to focus on – and make sure to achieves throughout the day.

                    And because it’s only three things, it still leaves room for other things that come up – so there’s built in flexibility too.</p>

               <p>Get it off your mind. Sometimes in the night we worry, waking up thinking about what we need to accomplish. This means we wake up already feeling behind. Instead, if there’s something you know you need to do,<b> write it down.</b></p>

             <h3>Read something that feeds your mind</h3>
             <p>My Dad loves reading the Wall Street Journal in the morning. It starts his day on the right foot.

                A friend of mine reads for 10 minutes and this habit has brought her immense joy. The way she sees it, if she reads a page a minute, her 10 minutes a day will turn into 3,650 pages read by the end of the year or 12 300-page books! For someone who could never find time to read, she’s now finishing great books and feeling awesome about it.</p>
